Customizing GitZenith is pretty easy since it was built on top of wonderful, modern and open-source projects. 

# Styles

The GitZenith gorgeous interface was built using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

# Templates

GitZenith is powered by the [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) template engine. All templates are available under `assets/themes/<theme_name>/templates`. In order to understand what is going on, I recommend that you read this [tutorial](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/templates.html). Enable debug in your `config.ini` or clean the contents of the `cache` folder to see `.twig` files changes!
